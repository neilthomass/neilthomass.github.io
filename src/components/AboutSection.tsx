      <p className="text-xl md:text-2xl text-white/90 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        As an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley, I aim to harness the power of machine learning to revolutionize traffic systems. I am passionate about developing intelligent models that optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve transportation safety. I seek to create adaptive, data-driven infrastructure that minimizes environmental impact and supports equitable urban development.
