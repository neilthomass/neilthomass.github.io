# About Me

![alt](Asset0008.jpeg)

I'm Neil Thomas, an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student at UC Berkeley with a passion for developing innovative solutions through technology.

## Education

I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. My academic journey has equipped me with strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and mathematical principles that drive modern computing.


## Professional Experience

My professional journey spans research, software engineering, and entrepreneurship:

- As a Research Assistant at Berkeley AI Research's Mobile Sensing Lab, I'm exploring efficient traffic flow using autonomous vehicles and reinforcement learning.
- With Arista Networks, I've developed AI documentation tools using LLMs and vector indexing.
- At Stealth Startup, I'm engineering real-time applications with Flutter and Dart.
- I founded RYDE, a carpooling initiative that reduced school-area traffic congestion and secured city funding.


## Technical Skills

I work with various technologies including:

- Languages: Python (NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Pandas), C++, C, Java, R, SQL, JS/TS
- Frameworks/Tools: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Wireshark, Docker, Git, AWS, Bash, REST, CUDA, LangChain
- Math: Linear Algebra, Probability, Bayesian Inference, Statistical Learning, Matrix Calculus
